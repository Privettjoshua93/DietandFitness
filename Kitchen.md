## Meal Prep Power Bowl

### Ingredients
- 6 boneless chicken thighs, or about 3-4 boneless breasts
- 1lb dry mixed beans 
- half cup apple cider vinegar
- half cup ponzu sauce
- 1 stick of butter
- 2 lemons (optional)*
- 1 bottle of lime juice
- 1 orange (optional)
- 1 pack of cherry tomatoes
- handful of herbs (optional)
- 1 bulb garlic
- pepper
- salt
- msg (optional)
- additional seasoning of your choice (I usually go with Lawrys and a pinch of cumin)

### Instructions
1. Wash beans, looking out for small rocks, then soak them in water overnight without salt at room temperature. 
2. Marinade the chicken in the lime juice, salt, halved and squeezed orange (optional), and seasoning of your choice,  overnight in the fridge.
3. After the beans have soaked overnight, replace the water before cooking, and salt to taste- set to boil.
4. Pat dry the chicken, then bake them at 350-400 with some olive oil until they're white all the way through (usually 35 minutes if the oven has been preheated)
5. Dice chop or slice garlic to taste, chop herbs, half tomatoes, and prepare lemons for squeezing.
6. Once the chicken and/or beans are almost finished, start the sauce by melting the butter in a pan, then add the garlic, simmering on about a medium-high. After a couple of minutes, add in the tomatoes and herbs, salt, pepper, and msg. After some time, add in the apple cider vinegar and ponzu sauce, squeeze the lemons, add the herbs, and then salt pepper and msg to taste. Simmer on medium, adding more butter and msg or salt if needed.
7. Remove the beans and chicken, chop up the chicken, add it all in a bowl, and pour the sauce on top.

### Notes
1. Careful with the salt. Lawrys, msg, and butter can all contain sodium. Remember, you can always add more but not take away.
2. Chicken breast is leaner than thighs, but thighs taste and cook better.
3. You can adjust your temperature while you are cooking- if things get too intense, just turn it off while you catch up, or turn it up if things are taking too long.
4. It keep in the fridge for 3-4 days, at least. It keeps in the freezer for a year, at least.
5. *Use the lemons if you're going to freeze it so the intensity of flavor is maintained, or if you just prefer a stronger dish.
