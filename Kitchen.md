## Meal Prep Power Bowl

### Ingredients
- 6 boneless chicken thighs, or about 3-4 boneless breasts
- 1lb dry mixed beans 
- half cup apple cider vinegar
- half cup ponzu sauce
- 1 stick of butter
- 2 lemons (optional)*
- 1 bottle of lime juice
- 1 orange (optional)
- 1 pack of cherry tomatoes
- handful of herbs (optional)
- 1 bulb garlic
- salt and pepper
- msg (optional)
- additional seasoning of your choice (I usually go with Lawrys and a pinch of cumin)

### Instructions
1. Wash beans, looking out for small rocks, then soak them in water overnight without salt at room temperature. 
2. Marinade the chicken in the lime juice, salt, halved and squeezed orange (optional), and seasoning of your choice,  overnight in the fridge.
3. After the beans have soaked overnight, replace the water before cooking, and salt to taste- set to boil.
4. Pat dry the chicken, then bake them at 350-400 with some olive oil until they're white all the way through (usually 35 minutes if the oven has been preheated)
5. Dice chop or slice garlic to taste, chop herbs, half tomatoes, and prepare lemons for squeezing.
6. Once the chicken and/or beans are almost finished, start the sauce by melting half the butter in a pan, then add the garlic, simmering on about a medium-high. After a couple of minutes, add in the tomatoes and herbs, salt, pepper, and msg, and other half of the butter. After some time, add in the apple cider vinegar and ponzu sauce, and squeeze the lemons. Simmer on medium, adding more butter and msg or salt to taste.
7. Remove everything from heat, chop up the chicken, add it all in a bowl, and pour the sauce on top.

### Notes and tips
1. Careful with the salt. Lawrys, msg, and butter can all contain sodium. Remember, you can always add more but not take away.
2. **Cook your chicken all the way, but don't overcook it. Dry chicken is bad, but even worse when it's reheated.**
3. Chicken breast is leaner than thighs, but thighs taste and cook better.
4. You can adjust your temperature while you are cooking- if things get too intense, just turn it off while you catch up, or turn it up if things are taking too long.
5. *Use the lemons if you're going to freeze it so the intensity of flavor is maintained, or if you just prefer a stronger dish.
6. All of the ingredient measurements are rough estimates, so be sure to employ your own judgement.
7. If your chicken finishes early, just take it out and finish your sauce.

## Chicken and/or Shrimp Pesto Pasta

### Ingredients
- chicken and/or shrimp (c/s)
- 1 stick of butter
- 1 pack sun dried tomatoes
- garlic
- 1 pack cherry tomatoes
- heavy whipping cream or half and half
- lots of fresh basil
- parmesan and/or mozzarella
- pasta of your choice
- black pepper (optional)

### Instructions
1. Soak the sun dried tomatoes in water for a couple of hours.
2. Prepare your garlic and basil. Half your cherry tomatoes.
3. If you're using chicken, cook the chicken with some oil and salt in the oven on 350 for 15-20 minutes beforehand then cut it into bite-sized pieces- it should be 75% finished, but may have a bit of color in the middle.
4. Boil water, and add the noodles with a small amount of salt for taste, taking off the heat once complete.
4. Add oil to the pan, and thrown in the c/s on high heat. Cook shrimp until it's pink, chicken until thoroughly cooked.
5. Turn down heat to medium, then add butter, sun dried tomatoes, and cherry tomatoes. Cook for a few more minutes.
6. Add some whipping cream, chopped basil, black pepper, and cheese, and cook until melted.
7. Strain the noodles well, and serve.

### Notes
1. I haven't tried freezing this, but I don't imagine it would be any good.
2. I have no idea what the portions are for this until I'm actively cooking it in front of me, so good luck.
